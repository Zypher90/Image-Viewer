# Image-Viewer
A mini image viewing application made using Java in NetBeans IDE.

This is a project made using Java Swing API in NetBeans environment. The application, or rather project, features the ability to zoom into images, select 
standalone image files and also to load folders which may or may not contain images on to the application. Even though this repo does not have a Java JAR 
executable, the repo can be cloned into local desktops and run using Java Maven. Plans are to add an executable version of this application with all its 
dependencies and resources included.

On a footnote and as an extended description to the project, it contains and lot of inefficient and unoptimized code that might appear absolutely HORRID to a 
developer, however this is not meant to be a "formal" application level program but rather a personal project to learn about the intricacies of the robust Swing
library of the Java programming language.

Lastly, I plan to add more features like editing images and video playing facilities to this project in the future.
